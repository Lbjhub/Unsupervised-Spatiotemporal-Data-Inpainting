# Unsupervised-Spatiotemporal-Data-Inpainting
Inpainting occlusions in images has been always a fascinating hard task for humans , the latter is harder when we extend it to videos and add a temporal axis . Researchers have been working on it for several decades achieving quite good results in a classical way but the texture was always not very smooth and somtimes blurry . However , recently with the success of "Deep Learning" , DL models have become ubiquitous in all tasks including **Inpainting** and especially GANs introduced in 2014 by 'Ian GOODFELLOW' inspired from Game theory which turn out to perform very well in this kind of problems .

Therefore , this repository is about the implementation of an ICLR 2020 accepted paper : https://openreview.net/forum?id=rylqmxBKvH tackling this problem in **an unsupervised context** titled "Unsupervised Spatiotemporal Data Inpainting" where we aim to implement it from scratch and reproduce experiments and results .

The main idea of the paper is **to inpaint occlusions on geophysical and natural videos sequencies in a fully unsupervised context** , where they introduce GANs paradigm in their architectures to solve this problem from a probabilistic viewpoint .

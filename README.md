# Unsupervised-Spatiotemporal-Data-Inpainting
Inpainting occlusions in images has been always a fascinating hard task for humans , the latter is harder when we extend it to videos and add a temporal axis . Researchers have been working on it for several decades achieving quite good results in a classical way but the texture was always not very smooth and somtimes blurry . However , recently with the success of "Deep Learning" , DL models have become ubiquitous in all tasks including **Inpainting** and especially GANs introduced in 2014 by 'Ian GOODFELLOW' inspired from Game theory which turn out to perform very well in this kind of problems .

Therefore , this repository is about the implementation of an ICLR 2020 accepted paper : https://openreview.net/forum?id=rylqmxBKvH tackling this problem in **an unsupervised context** titled "Unsupervised Spatiotemporal Data Inpainting" where we aim to implement it from scratch and reproduce experiments and results .

The main idea of the paper is **to inpaint occlusions on geophysical and natural videos sequencies in a fully unsupervised context** , where they introduce GANs paradigm in their architectures to solve this problem from a probabilistic viewpoint .

## Requirements
- ffmpeg : ``` sudo install ffmpeg ``` 
TO DO : List them 
TO DO : Install them from a text file 

## Usage 

### Data 
#### Download the data

```bash Data/ALL_IN_ONE_data_downloader.sh``` to download everything at once ( **Note** : BAIR data size is +30GB , thus we recommend to not download it for the first time while testing the app and getting it touch with it ... )

```bash Data/ALL_IN_ONE_data_downloader.sh FaceForensics KTH SST```
#### Apply preprocessing + occlusions
``` python Data/preprocess.py [Args]* ```
Arguments are : 
* ```--datasets```   : datasets to process    , **default = "FaceForensics,KTH"**
* ```--occlusions``` : occlusions to perform  , **default = ""moving_bar,raindrops,remove_pixels""**

OTHERS TO DO


typical tree for datasets is : 
/Data/datasets/$dataset_name/
                            |-- raw-data
                            |-- occluded-data
                            |-- resized-data
                                    
After doing the 2 steps cited above try to explore this folder for a better understanding of how the data is organized .
